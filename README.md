# Practical6 


## Google Colab
In [this practical](https://github.com/KF5012-AI2021/Practical6) we will focus on using GPUs for deep learning. We will also look at python classes which you may not yet have seen. Finally we will see how you can use an LSTM (long short term memory for time series prediction). 

Open up [GoogleColab](https://colab.research.google.com/) and import the notebooks in this repository to get started. You can do this by clicking File -> Open Notebook -> Github and search for KF5012-AI2021.

## What is in this Practical Session
1. Deep Models and Transfer Learning
2. Data Augmentation with Keras
3. Python Classes
4. Recurrent Neural Networks for Time Series Prediction

It is suggested to read the notebooks in the above order. Models from notebooks 1 and 2 will take some time to train, so you can have a look at notebooks 3 and 4 while you wait.
